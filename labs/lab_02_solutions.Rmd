## Exercise 1

```{r}
new_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007, 
         lifeExp >= 70, 
         gdpPercap <= 20000)
```


## Exercise 2

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  count(continent)
```

## Exercise 3

```{r}
new_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_percap = log(gdpPercap))
```

## Exercise 4

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_percap = log(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(year == 2007, lifeExp >= 70) %>%
  summarize(median_log_gdp = median(log_gdp_percap))
```


## Exercise 5

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_percap = log(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(year == 2007, lifeExp >= 70) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(median_log_gdp = median(log_gdp_percap))
```

## Exercise 6

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, 
             y = lifeExp,
             color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (US $)",
       y = "Life expectancy at birth (years)",
       title = "Life expectancy vs. GDP per capita",
       color = "Continent") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 7

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_percap = log(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log_gdp_percap, 
             y = lifeExp,
             color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "log GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy at birth (years)",
       title = "Life expectancy vs. log GDP per capita",
       color = "Continent") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Exercise 8

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_percap = log(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(median_life_exp = median(lifeExp),
            r = cor(lifeExp, log_gdp_percap))
```

## Exercise 9

There appears to be a strong, positive nonlinear relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy at birth. The relationship is curved, with the life expectancy leveling off as GDP per capita increases (possibly because of biological limits to human life expectancy). From the scatterplot and summary statistics, we can see that African countries tend to have lower GDP per capita and life expectancy than countries in other continents, while European countries tend to have the highest life expectancy and GDP per capita.

## Exercise 10

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_percap = log(gdpPercap)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log_gdp_percap, 
             y = lifeExp,
             color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(x = "log GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy at birth (years)",
       title = "Life expectancy vs. log GDP per capita, by year",
       color = "Continent") +
  theme_bw()
```


## Exercise 11

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarize(median_life_exp = median(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = median_life_exp, 
             color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Median life expectancy at birth (years)",
       color = "Continent",
       title = "Median life expectancy over time") +
  theme_bw()
```


## Exercise 12

From the plot in exercise 10, we can see that countries around the world have made gains in life expectancy, and GDP per capita has increased for many countries. However, it is hard to tell from exercise 10 whether inequality has decreased. It is easier to assess inequality from exercise 11. We can see that the Americas and Asia have almost caught up to Europe and Oceania when it comes to median life expectancy. However, Africa is still just as far away as it was 50 years ago.

While these plots start to address the research question, there are some drawbacks. First, by taking the median life expectancy in each continent, we ignore variability in life expectancy *within* each continent. Second, we're not measuring inequality directly. If we created a measure of inequality that we could track directly, it might be easier to answer our question.
