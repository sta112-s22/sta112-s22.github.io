In this activity, you will practice fitting a regression model with a quantitative response and a single categorical predictor.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
drosophila <- read_csv("https://sta112-s22.github.io/class_activities/drosophila.csv")
diet_lm <- lm(WingLength ~ Diet, data = drosophila)
```

## Setup

Researchers are interested in investigating the relationship between diet and wing length for fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*). In an experiment, they randomly assign infant flies to one of three diet groups: Standard, Rich, and Poor. They then measure each fly's wing length when they reach maturity.

You can load the data as follows:

```r
drosophila <- read_csv("https://sta112-s22.github.io/class_activities/drosophila.csv")
```

### Modeling

We can visualize the relationship between diet and wing length with boxplots:

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center'}
drosophila %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Diet, y = WingLength)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
``` 

We will model this relationship as

$\text{WingLength} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{IsRich} + \beta_2 \text{IsStandard} + \varepsilon$,

where $\text{IsRich}$ and $\text{IsStandard}$ are indicator variables for Diet:

```{marginfigure}
There are lots of different notation for indicator variables. For example, R would call these indicators `Dietrich` and `Dietstandard`. Other notation includes $I_{\text{rich}}$ and $I_{\text{standard}}$.
```

$\text{IsRich} = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{Diet } \neq \text{rich} \\ 1 & \text{Diet } = \text{rich} \end{cases}$

$\text{IsStandard} = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{Diet } \neq \text{standard} \\ 1 & \text{Diet } = \text{standard} \end{cases}$


## Questions

1. Use the `lm` function to fit the regression model with Diet as the predictor and WingLength as the response.

<SCRIPT>
function ShowAndHide(divid) {
    var x = document.getElementById(divid);
    if (x.style.display == 'none') {
        x.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
        x.style.display = 'none';
    }
}

<DIV ID="q1_solution" STYLE="display:none">
```r
diet_lm <- lm(WingLength ~ Diet, data = drosophila)
```
</DIV>

2. What is the estimated average WingLength for drosophila in each diet type?

<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('q2_solution')">Solution</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="q2_solution" STYLE="display:none">
```{r}
summary(diet_lm)
```

| Diet | $\widehat{\text{WingLength}}$ |
| --- | --- |
| Poor | 1.88 |
| Rich | 1.88 + 0.16 = 2.04 |
| Standard | 1.88 + 0.12 = 2.00 |

</DIV>

3. Use `dplyr` functions to calculate the sample mean WingLength for each diet in the `drosophila` data. How do your answers compare to question 2?

<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('q3_solution')">Solution</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="q3_solution" STYLE="display:none">
```{r}
drosophila %>%
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarize(mean_WingLength = mean(WingLength))
```

</DIV>

:::{.question}
*What's going on here?*

When we have a quantitative response and a single categorical predictor, then the predicted value of the response is just the sample mean in each group!
:::

4. How many degrees of freedom does the fitted model from question 1 have?

<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('q4_solution')">Solution</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="q4_solution" STYLE="display:none">
The fitted model has 1369 = 1372 - 3 degrees of freedom (remember that we lose one degree of freedom for each parameter we estimate. We estimated $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$.)

</DIV>

5. Assess the constant variance and normality assumptions for the regression model. Do these assumptions appear reasonable?

<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('q5_solution')">Solution</BUTTON>

<DIV ID="q5_solution" STYLE="display:none">
Residual boxplot:
```{r}
drosophila %>%
  mutate(resids = residuals(diet_lm)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Diet, y = resids)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Diet", 
       y = "Residuals")
```

Residual standard deviation in each group:

```{r}
drosophila %>%
  mutate(resids = residuals(diet_lm)) %>%
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarize(residual_std_dev = sd(resids))
```

QQ plot:

```{r}
drosophila %>%
  mutate(resids = residuals(diet_lm)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = resids)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Theoretical normal quantiles", 
       y = "Observed residual quantiles")
```

Both the constant variance and normality assumptions appear to be violated. For the constant variance assumption, there is noticeably more variability in residuals for the Poor diet group, and the residual standard deviation for the Poor group is more than twice the residual standard deviation for the Standard group. For the normality assumption, the QQ plot shows that the left tail is far away from the theoretical normal distribution.
