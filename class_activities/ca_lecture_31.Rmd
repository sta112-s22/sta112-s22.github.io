## Setup

In this activity, we will revisit the `Kershaw` data from Homework 7. To load the data, run

```r
library(Stat2Data)
data("Kershaw")
```

As in Homework 7, we will focus on the following variables:

* `Result`: a negative result (a ball or a hit), or a positive result (a strike or an out)
* `EndSpeed`: the speed at which the ball crossed home plate (in mph)

We are interested in the logistic regression model for the relationship between end speed and result:

$\log \left( \dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ \text{speed}$,

where $\pi$ is the probability of a positive result.

1. You are interested in testing whether there is any relationship between whether a pitch is successful and the speed at which it crosses home plate. Carry out both a Wald test and a likelihood ratio test to investigate this question, and report your results. *In practice, we would just do one test, rather than both of them. But since this is a class activity, I want you to try both tests.*

<SCRIPT>
function ShowAndHide(divid) {
    var x = document.getElementById(divid);
    if (x.style.display == 'none') {
        x.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
        x.style.display = 'none';
    }
}

**Wald test:**

```{r, include=F}
library(Stat2Data)
data("Kershaw")
```

```{r}
kershaw_glm <- glm(Result ~ EndSpeed, data = Kershaw, family=binomial)
summary(kershaw_glm)
```

test statistic: $z = 3.881$. p-value = 0.000104. This p-value is small, so we have strong evidence that there is a relationship between pitch speed and result.

**Likelihood ratio test:**

full model: $\log \left( \dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ \text{speed}$

reduced model: $\log \left( \dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi} \right) = \beta_0$

test statistic: $G = 4540.4 - 4525.4 = 15.0$

degrees of freedom: 1 (we are testing a single parameter), so $G \sim \chi^2_1$

p-value:

```{r}
pchisq(15, df=1, lower.tail=F)
```

2. Instead of the research question in exercise 1, you want to know whether faster pitches are more likely to be successful. Write down your hypotheses in terms of a parameter in the model.

3. Which test (Wald, likelihood ratio, or both) can you use to test the hypotheses in question 2? Carry out the hypothesis test.

4. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_1$ in the logistic regression model.

5. Instead of the interval in exercise 4, you want a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio for an increase of 1mph in pitch speed. How can you calculate this confidence interval using your answer to exercise 4?
