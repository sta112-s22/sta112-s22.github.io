## Survival on the Titanic

On April 15, 1912 the RMS *Titanic* sank after colliding with an iceberg, and hundreds of passengers aboard died in the disaster. As dramatized in the movie *Titanic*, the odds of survival were much better for first-class passengers (the richest on board) than for second and third class passengers.

Here we have data on 891 *Titanic* passengers, showing survival by class.

| | First class | Second and third class | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Survived | 136 | 206 | 342 |
| Did not survive | 80 | 469 | 549 |
| Total | 216 | 675 | 891 |

1. What was the probability of survival for first-class passengers?


2. What were the odds of survival for first-class passengers?


3. Calculate the odds ratio comparing odds of survival for first-class passengers to odds of survival for second and third class passengers.
