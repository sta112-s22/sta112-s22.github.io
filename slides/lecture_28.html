# Introduction to logistic regression

---


### Agenda

.large[
* Extra credit 2 released on course website
* Project 1, Part 5 due next Monday
* Remaining assignments:
  * One more HW
  * Project 2
* No class this Friday (holiday)
* Today: begin logistic regression
]

---

### Data

.large[
55 students applying to medical school, with the following information on each student:
* `Acceptance`: whether the student was accepted to medical school (1 = accepted, 0 = denied)
* `GPA`: the student's college GPA
* `MCAT`: the student's MCAT score
]

---

### Linear regression

.large[

&lt;img src="lecture_28_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`$$MCAT = \beta_0 + \beta_1 GPA + \varepsilon$$`
.question[
What if our response isn't quantitative?
]

]

---

### Binary response

.large[

&lt;img src="lecture_28_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`$$Acceptance \overset{?}{=} \beta_0 + \beta_1 GPA + \varepsilon$$`
.question[
What are the issues with this model?
]

]

---

### Issues with a binary response

.large[
&lt;img src="lecture_28_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Acceptance is either 0 or 1 -- we can't have any other values

.question[
How could we change the model to address this issue?
]
]

---

### Working with probabilities

.large[
&lt;img src="lecture_28_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* `\(P(Acceptance = 1)\)` = probability student is accepted
* `\(P(Acceptance = 1) \overset{?}{=} \beta_0 + \beta_1 GPA\)`

.question[
Does this fix our issues with the model?
]
]

---

### Issues with probabilities

.large[
&lt;img src="lecture_28_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* probabilities (e.g., `\(P(Acceptance = 1)\)` ) are between 0 and 1
* Lines are never constrained, unless the slope is 0
]

---

### Exploring binary outcomes

.large[
.question[
How can I summarize binary variables?
]

* Probabilities
* Odds
* Odds ratios
]

.large[
`$$\text{Odds} = \dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$$`

.question[
Probabilities are between 0 and 1. What range of values can odds take?
]

.abox[
(A) between 0 and 1

### Log odds

.large[
**Definition:** Let `\(\pi\)` denote the probability an event happens (e.g., `\(\pi = P(Acceptance = 1)\)` ). Then the *log odds* are

`$$\log \left(\dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi}\right)$$`

.question[

]

.abox[
(A) between 0 and 1
]

.bbox[
(B) between 0 and `\(\infty\)`
]

.cbox[
(C) between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`
]
]

--

.large[
**Answer:** between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`
]

---

### Logistic regression

.large[
**Logistic regression model:**

`\(\pi = P(Acceptance = 1)\)`

`\(\log \left(\dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 GPA\)`

* log odds are between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`, so we can use a line!

.question[
Where did the `\(\varepsilon\)` term go?
]
]

--

.large[
* The `\(\varepsilon\)` term is used to include randomness in the model
* The probability `\(\pi\)` *already* incorporates randomness 
* The probability and log odds are not random themselves; they describe randomness for the response

]

.cbox[
(C) `\(-2.86\)`
