## Research question

--

* Do home teams perform better when they have more fans present?

---

## Data

--

* Results and attendances downloaded from [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
* Attendance data also collected from NBA and local news

--

.question[
Issue: reported attendance sometimes inaccurate!
]

---

## Methods

--

* Linear regression model
    - Includes other potential factors that could influence outcome of game
* Hypothesis tests for strength of the relationship

---

## Conclusions

--

* An increase of 1,000 home fans is associated with an increase of 1.4 points in the home team's margin of victory, after controlling for other factors
* So, home teams tend to perform better when they have more fans
* Is there anything you would do differently?

---

## Reproducibility

.question[
Could you reproduce their results?
]

--

Possibly, but it would be hard.
* Data doesn't seem to be available (we would have to collect it ourselves)
* Code for analysis not available

Extra credit 1: write code to scrape the data from Basketball-Reference.com

## Components of (good) data analysis

## Mental health

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask
for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. The University Counseling Center is here to help: call 336-758-5273 or visit their website at [https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/](https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/).

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately,
day or night:
Counseling Center: 336-758-5273

If the situation is life threatening, call the police:
911 or 336-758-5911 (campus police)

## Accessibility

If you require accommodations due to a disability or other learning differences, contact Learning Assistance Center & Disability Services at 336-758-5929 or lacds@wfu.edu as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please feel free
to contact me, and I will be happy to discuss any necessary accommodations. I always like
to know how to help my students feel comfortable and successful in our course.

**Scent-free zone:** The 3rd floor of Manchester is a scent-free zone. Please refrain from wearing perfume, cologne, scented lotion, body spray, and all other scented products when visiting the 3rd floor.

## Academic integrity

**Do:**

- Work together on classwork, labs, homeworks
- Acknowledge your collaborators 
- Write up the assignments yourself
- Use the internet (e.g. StackOverflow) for help
- Cite your sources
- Work independently for projects and quizzes

**Don't:**

- Copy someone else's work
- Use resources without citation

## Extensions and late work

**Extensions:** You have a bank of **5** extension days, which you may use over the course of the semester. You may use either one or two days for a given assignment.

**Late work:** An assignment will be marked off 20% for every 24 hours it is late (past the original due date).

Example: If an assignment is turned in:
* 30 minutes -- 24 hours late: lose 20% of points
* 24 -- 48 hours late: lose 40% of points.

If you know you cannot turn in an assignment (for instance, if you are ill or there is a family emergency), let me know before the assignment is due, and we will work something out. There will be no grade changes
after our last day of class.
