### Agenda

.large[
* Project 1, Part 1 released
  * Due next Friday
* Today:
  * Intro to project
  * Data wrangling
]

---

### Project 1

.large[
Data from the College Scorecard, a tool to compare student outcomes at different educational institutions. Goal: advise prospective students who are applying to college. 

.question[
**Research questions:**

* Do students who graduate from more expensive schools earn more money after graduation?
* Is the relationship between school cost and graduate earnings the same for public and private schools?
]
]

---

### Rough project outline

.large[
We will build up the project over the course of the semester. Different components on:

* Exploratory data analysis (Part 1, out today)
* Data analysis plan
* Written final report
]

---

### Part 1: EDA

.large[
Conduct initial exploratory data analysis and create a short report, including:
* Data summary (what does a row in the data represent, any missing values, etc.)
* Univariate EDA (describe distributions of individual variables)
* Multivariate EDA (start to look at relationships between variables)

(Full details on the project assignment)
]

---

### Starting points for data analysis

.large[
* Begin with a subset of the data
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
* Create new variables

.question[
**Data wrangling:** Manipulating, summarizing, and transforming data.
]
]

### Penguins data

.large[
Data on 344 penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Variables include:

* `species`: penguin's species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
* `island`: island where penguin measured (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)
* `bill_length_mm`: penguin's bill length (mm)
* `bill_depth_mm`: penguin's bill depth (mm)
* `flipper_length_mm`: penguin's flipper length (mm)
* `body_mass_g`: penguin's body mass (g)
* `sex`: penguin's sex (female, male)
* `year`: year when data recorded (2007, 2008, 2009)
]

.question[
We get this data set -- where do we start?
]
]

### Making a subset of the data

.large[
.question[
We have three species of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo). Let's make a subset with just the Chinstrap penguins.
]
]

--

.large[
**Step 1:** What data do I start with?

```{r}
penguins
```
]

]

**Step 2:** What do I do to that data?


```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")
```
]

```{r, echo=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")
```

**Step 2:** What do I do to that data?

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%

```

* `%>%` is called the *pipe*. It means "take `<this>`, THEN do `<that>`"
* `filter` keeps only the rows which satisfy a specific condition

.question[
We have three species of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo). Let's make a subset with just the Chinstrap penguins.
]

**Step 3:** What do I do with the result?

```{r, eval = F}
chinstrap_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")
```

* `<-` is the *assignment* operator. It means "save the result in R"
  * Here we create a new data frame called `chinstrap_penguins` that contains just the Chinstraps

chinstrap_penguins

chinstrap_penguins
```

### Starting points for data analysis

.large[
* Work with a smaller, manageable subset of the data
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
* Create new variables
]

---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What is the average body mass for Chinstrap penguins?
]
]

--

.large[
**Step 1:** What data do I start with?

```{r}
chinstrap_penguins
```
]

---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What is the average body mass for Chinstrap penguins?
]

**Step 2:** What do I do to that data?


```{r, eval=F}
chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

```{r, echo=F}
chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

.large[
* `%>%` is called the *pipe*. It means "take `<this>`, THEN do `<that>`"
* `summarize` is used to calculate summary statistics
]
---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What is the average body mass for Chinstrap penguins?
]

**Step 3:** (optional) Do I want to save the result?

```{r, eval=F}
chinstrap_summary <- chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

---

### Chaining pipes together

.large[
If we don't care about the intermediate results, we can chain pipes (`%>%`) together. These two chunks calculate the same summary statistics.


**Option 1:**

```{r, eval=F}
chinstrap_penguins <- penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")

chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```


**Option 2:**

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What if I want the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What if I want the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What is the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

```{r, echo=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

.large[
.question[
What does a result of `NA` mean?
]
]

--

.large[
* `NA` means "Not Available"
* We get `NA` when there are missing values
]

---

### Handling missing values

.large[
.question[
What is the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

```{r, echo=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

.large[
* `drop_na` means "remove any rows with missing values in any columns"
]
---

### Handling missing values

.large[
* `drop_na` removes *all* rows with missing values (not just missing values in `body_mass_g`)
* Reasonable if this is a small number of rows
* When you have missing values, check how much data is missing
]
---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What is the average body mass for *each* species of penguin?
]
]

--

.large[
```{r}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```
]

--

.large[
* `group_by` is used to group rows together
* We often use `group_by` before `summarize`
]
---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
What is the mean and standard deviation of body mass, for each species and sex?
]
]

.large[
```{r, output.lines=5:9, message=F}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g),
            sd_mass = sd(body_mass_g))
```
]

---

### Calculating summary statistics

.large[
.question[
How many penguins of each species and sex are there?
]
]

.large[
```{r}
penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  count(species, sex)
```
]

---

### Starting points for data analysis

.large[
* Work with a smaller, manageable subset of the data
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
* Create new variables
]

---

### Creating new variables

.large[
.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]
]

--

.large[
**Step 1:** Create a new variable

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  mutate(bf_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm)
```
]

```{r, output.lines=2:10, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
penguins %>%
  mutate(bf_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm) %>%
  select(species, island, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, bf_ratio)
```


---

### Creating new variables

.large[
.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]

**Step 1:** Create a new variable

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  mutate(bf_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm)
```

* `mutate` creates a new column in your dataset
]

---

### Creating new variables

.large[
.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]

**Step 2:** Save the data with the new column

```{r, eval=F}
penguins_new <- penguins %>%
  mutate(bf_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm)
```
]

---

### Creating new variables

.large[
**Step 3:** Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
penguins_new <- penguins %>%
  mutate(bf_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm)

penguins_new %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean_ratio = mean(bf_ratio))
```
]

---

### Starting points for data analysis

.large[
* Work with a smaller, manageable subset of the data
  * `filter`
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
  * `summarize`, `group_by`, `count`, `drop_na`
* Create new variables
  * `mutate`
]
